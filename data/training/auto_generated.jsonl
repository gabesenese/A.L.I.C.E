The Sun is an G-type main-sequence star (that's a fancy way of saying it's a medium-sized yellow dwarf). It's about 93 million miles away from us, but its light takes only about 8 minutes to reach Earth. That's why we see it during the day and it's not just because it's close - it's actually a really long way off!\n\nThe Sun is so massive that it makes up 99.86% of our solar system's mass. It's also incredibly hot, with surface temperatures reaching around 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000\u00b0F). But don't worry, that heat is what makes life on Earth possible - without the Sun's energy, we wouldn't have photosynthesis or any other process that relies on light.\n\nDid you know that the Sun is actually a bit of an oddball? Most stars are either much smaller or much larger than our Sun. It's also incredibly stable, which might seem boring but it's actually really important for life as we know it. The Sun's stability means it can provide consistent energy to Earth over billions of years.\n\nWhat do you want to know more about the Sun?
