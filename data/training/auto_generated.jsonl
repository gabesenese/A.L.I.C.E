Alternatively, if you're using a task management app or service like Todoist, Trello, or Wunderlist, you can log in to those platforms and delete the list from within the app.\n\nIf you'd like some help finding where your old todo list might be stored or have any trouble deleting it, I'm happy to try and assist you!", "teacher_response": "I'll remove your old todo list for you.
