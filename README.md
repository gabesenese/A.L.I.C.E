# Speech Engine for AI Assistant

This project aims to create a custom AI assistant inspired by JARVIS, including building a text-to-speech (TTS) engine from scratch using Python. The TTS engine follows a basic concatenative synthesis approach to generate speech from text.

## Features

- **Text Analysis and Normalization:** Converts input text into a readable format.
- **Phonetic Analysis:** Translates text into phonemes using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.
- **Waveform Synthesis:** Generates speech by concatenating pre-recorded phoneme audio files.
