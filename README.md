# A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Linguistic Intelligent Companion Entity)

A.L.I.C.E is a sophisticated AI model designed to serve as a versatile, conversational assistant. Leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, A.L.I.C.E aims to provide human-like interactions and assist users in a variety of tasks.

## Overview

A.L.I.C.E is an envisioned as an intelligent assistant capable of understanding and responding to human language in a natural and coherent manner. The ultimate goal is to create an AI that can assist users in their daily tasks, provide information, and engage in meaningful conversations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **dataset.py**: This script helps with loading and processing various datasets used to train A.L.I.C.E.
- **ai_model.py**: This script defines the neural network architecture and training procedures.
- **ai_engine.py**: The main engine that integrates the NLP processor, the dataset loader, and the AI model to create a functional conversational AI.
- **nlp_processor.py**: This script contains the natural language processing functions and classes used for text processing and vectorization.
